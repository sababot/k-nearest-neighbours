<h1 align="center">K Nearest Neighbours</h1>
This is a simple implementation of the "k-nearest-neighbours" algorithm, a machine learning algorithm which is part of the supervised learning set and is used to determine patterns in data. Additionally, this algorithm is primarily used to create group in data sets.

<h1 align="center">Training Data</h1>
This is the training data used for this algirhtm which is currently hard coded but shortly, this implementation will be updated to allow the importation of csv files and to be used as training data.
